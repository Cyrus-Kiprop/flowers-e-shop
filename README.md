# Capstone - The Flower-e-shop

> This is my last but not least project in the HTML/CSS section of the Microverse main curriculum. The main goal of this milestone is to enable the learner to apply the newly acquired HTML and CSS skills in designing a real world capstone project that is fully responsive and eye captivating. In this project, I purely demonstrate mastery in the following areas:

- Proper use of HTML semantics, and elements, and their respective attributes
- UI/UX design using CSS,
  -CSS pseudo selectors and classes
- Typography ,
- Bootstrap classes for responsive design

So far this is my biggest achievement.
