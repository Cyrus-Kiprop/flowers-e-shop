# HTML Responsive Design - The News Week Project

> This is my seventh project in the HTML/CSS section of the Microverse main curriculum. The main goal of this milestone is to equip the learner with the ability to design responsive layouts, using bootstrap framework thus implementing different styles at certain breaking points.

This has been by far my biggest and most complex assignment, but I learned a great deal in responsive design especially using bootstrap framework.
